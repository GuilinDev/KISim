# Changelog

All notable changes to KISim will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-05-24

### Added
- Initial release of KISim (Kubernetes Intelligent Scheduling Simulator)
- Complete baseline experiment framework with 4 load patterns (ramp, spike, periodic, random)
- PPO-based reinforcement learning agent for Kubernetes scheduling
- GPU and CPU deployment variants for performance comparison
- MobileNetV4 inference workload with Triton Inference Server
- Comprehensive metrics collection (latency, throughput, resource utilization)
- Automated experiment orchestration with Makefile
- Publication-ready visualization and analysis tools
- Academic-quality documentation and architecture design
- Unit tests and example configurations
- MIT license for open source distribution

### Core Components
- **Baseline Experiments**: Traditional Kubernetes scheduling evaluation
- **RL Training**: PPO agent with Kubernetes environment integration
- **Load Generation**: Locust-based dynamic load testing
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus-based monitoring and analysis
- **Visualization**: Publication-ready plots and comparative analysis
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage guides

### Supported Platforms
- **Kubernetes**: MicroK8s, Kind, standard clusters
- **Hardware**: NVIDIA GPU support (RTX 3080 tested)
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (primary), other Linux distributions
- **Python**: 3.8+ with virtual environment support

### Experimental Features
- Multi-objective reward function optimization
- Dynamic replica scaling based on performance metrics
- Real-time load pattern adaptation
- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
- Cross-platform deployment compatibility

### Known Limitations
- Single-node testing environment (multi-node support planned)
- Limited to MobileNetV4 workload (extensible architecture)
- GPU dependency for optimal performance (CPU fallback available)
- Requires Kubernetes cluster setup and configuration

### Future Roadmap
- Multi-node cluster support for production-scale testing
- Additional ML workloads (BERT, ResNet, etc.)
- Advanced RL algorithms (A3C, SAC, etc.)
- Real-time policy adaptation and online learning
- Federated learning across multiple clusters
- Integration with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
